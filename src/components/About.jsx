            I am a passionate developer with a strong interest in cybersecurity and low-level development. I enjoy solving complex problems, whether itâ€™s building a robust packet sniffer, exploring advanced techniques in red teaming, or designing algorithms to generate wordlists for penetration testing. My experience spans across several technologies, including Node.js, C++, and MongoDB, with a focus on building efficient, console-based applications and integrating various systems for optimal performance.
            Currently, I am working on a project that combines my love for wordlists and cybersecurity, developing a tool to generate custom wordlists based on clues.
